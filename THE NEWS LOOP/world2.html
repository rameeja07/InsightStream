 <h3>
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday he had decided to resign, ushering in a potentially lengthy period of policy paralysis at a shaky moment for the world’s fourth-largest economy.

Ishiba, 68, instructed his Liberal Democratic Party – which has governed Japan for almost all of the post-war era - to hold an emergency leadership race, he told a press conference, adding he would continue his duties until his successor was elected.
<BR><br>
Since coming to power less than a year ago, Ishiba has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.

Until Sunday, he had refused calls to step down following the latest of those losses in July’s upper house vote. He had focused instead on ironing out details of a trade deal with the United States on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have roiled Japan’s critical automotive industry and cast a shadow over weak growth.

<P>The 68-year-old leader, who took office last October, had resisted calls to quit for weeks, warning that stepping down would create a political vacuum at a time when Japan faces “big challenges” — including US tariffs, rising prices, rice policy reforms and growing regional tensions.

But Ishiba’s position weakened after back-to-back election defeats, with his ruling coalition losing majorities in both houses of parliament. <br><br>His resignation came just a day before the LDP was due to vote on whether to call an early leadership election — a move seen as a de facto no-confidence motion against him.

Party heavyweights, including conservative veteran Taro Aso and several cabinet ministers, had openly demanded his exit. On Saturday, Ishiba met with Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, both of whom reportedly urged him to step aside ahead of the vote.<br></h3>
“With Japan having signed the trade agreement and the president having signed the executive order, we have passed a key hurdle,” Ishiba said, his voice catching with emotion. “I would like to pass the baton to the next generation.”<br><br>

The LDP will hold an emergency leadership contest, with possible successors including Sanae Takaichi, a party veteran critical of the Bank of Japan’s rate hikes, and Shinjiro Koizumi, Ishiba’s farm minister and a rising star in the party. Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in last year’s LDP run-off.

“Given the political pressure mounting on Ishiba after the LDP's repeated election losses, his resignation was inevitable,” Kazutaka Maeda, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute, was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters. “Koizumi and Takaichi are seen as the most likely candidates.”

Analysts say the new leader could call a snap election to strengthen their mandate. But a Kyodo poll published Sunday showed 55% of people believe there is no need for an early vote, as per a Reuters report.

Ishiba’s last major act as prime minister was finalising a trade deal with the United States. The agreement reduced Trump’s tariffs on Japanese goods from 25% to 15% in return for $550 billion of Japanese investments. He also sent a personal letter to Trump, expressing hope for a “golden era” in the alliance and inviting him to visit Japan.
