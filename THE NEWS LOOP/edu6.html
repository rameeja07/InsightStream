<h3>The new social science textbook for Class 7 students following NCERT's curriculum has no references to the Mughal rule and the Delhi Sultanate. Earlier, NCERT -- the National Council of Educational Research and Training -- had trimmed sections on the Mughals and Delhi Sultanate. This time, they have disappeared entirely.

The new textbooks have been prepared in line with the new National Education Policy and National Curriculum Framework for School Education, 2023.</h3>
