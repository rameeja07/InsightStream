   <h2><b>GAIN AI Act akin to diffusion law, Nvidia says</b></h2>
   <p><i></i>Like light through a prism, the GAIN AI Act guides innovation without blocking its brilliance.</i></p>

    <h3>Nvidia recently likened the GAIN AI Act to a “diffusion law,” suggesting that the legislation could guide the spread of artificial intelligence much like natural laws govern the flow of particles or energy. In this context, the act is not seen as a barrier but as a framework that ensures AI technologies are distributed safely, transparently, and responsibly. By drawing parallels to the laws of diffusion, Nvidia implies that thoughtful regulation can help AI reach its full potential across industries while minimizing risks. The goal is to encourage innovation while maintaining ethical oversight and equitable access. </h3>
