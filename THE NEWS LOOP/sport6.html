Iyer's rise to captaincy was marked by his consistent performances and leadership in the Indian Premier League (IPL). In the 2025 season, he captained Punjab Kings to the final, showcasing his tactical acumen and composure under pressure.

His appointment as captain reflects a strategic shift by the BCCI, aiming to build a team for the future while maintaining a balance of experience and youth. Under his leadership, India is poised to compete strongly in the upcoming international tournaments.</h3>
