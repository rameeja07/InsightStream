   <h3>
    Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that 7,768 instructor posts have been approved in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), including 6,577 regular and 1,191 outsourced positions,
     while distributing appointment letters to newly selected candidates through UPSSSC.
   </h3>
<p>Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath handed over appointment letters to newly selected instructors, highlighting the state government’s merit-based and transparent recruitment process.

The CM noted that under his administration, recruitment has improved compared to earlier regimes, where "so much money was taken that they could not even look into the eyes of candidates."

The distribution at Lok Bhavan saw 11 instructors receive letters directly from the CM, while a total of 1,510 candidates received their appointment letters through the Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Services Selection Commission (UPSSSC). Similar ceremonies were organised across the state, according to an official statement from the Chief Minister’s office.

Congratulating the appointees and their families, Yogi Adityanath said that government jobs in Uttar Pradesh are now earned through honesty and hard work. He highlighted that in the last eight years, 8.5 lakh youths have secured government employment through regular recruitment conducted via commissions and boards. "Today, there is a shower of jobs in UP, both in the government and private sectors. The youth selected through fair recruitment are now serving the state with honesty and energy," he added.

The CM contrasted the current situation with conditions before 2017, when the state faced multiple development challenges. "Earlier, youths faced an identity crisis outside the state, and UP was seen as a barrier to the nation's development. But in the last eight years, we have transformed UP into the country's number two economy and the growth engine of India," he said. He credited this transformation to the combined efforts of 25 crore people, public representatives, government officers, and the double-engine government. "Today, UP is counted among the fastest growing states with the highest development rate in the country. Where the state was once in the bottom five, it now ranks among the top three in most schemes and is number one in many," he asserted.

Yogi Adityanath emphasised that the new instructors are a reflection of the state’s fair recruitment process and urged them to guide ITI students with sincerity. He reminded them that "while wasting time may bring momentary satisfaction, time never forgives, and only honest effort leads to real results."

On training and professional development, the CM said, "There should be no hesitation in learning and teaching others. The trade and its nuances may evolve with time, but constant learning will make you an expert. The youth you would train in the future should be so competent that no one in the global market can question their skills."

The CM instructed the vocational education, entrepreneurship, and skill development departments to collaborate with the MSME and labour-employment departments to create wider employment opportunities. He also noted the growing scale of government jobs, citing the PET exam, which saw 25 lakh participants: "If we connect the scale of 25 lakh with skill, then every hand will have work, and no one will remain unemployed."

Regarding youth entrepreneurship, the CM explained the scheme launched in January, which has already reached over 70,000 youths, with a goal of connecting one lakh young individuals annually.

The program was attended by Minister of State (Independent Charge) Kapil Dev Agarwal, MLA Neeraj Bora, MLC Mukesh Sharma, Lalji Prasad Nirmal, Ramchandra Pradhan, Eng. Avneesh Singh, Acting Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar, Principal Secretary Hariom, and others. At Lok Bhavan, 460 newly appointed instructors were present, while the remaining candidates received letters at local offices.
