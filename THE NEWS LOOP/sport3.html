<h3>As Tom Brady prepares for his 10th Super Bowl, Sunday, within a 21-year career as an NFL quarterback, many are wondering how he has lasted this long and with such great success. To walk away with his seventh championship, though, Brady and his Tampa Bay Buccaneers will need to beat the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and their own star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes.

The two all-pro QBs are on opposite ends of the spectrum as it relates to their time in the league – and on Earth.

Brady, 43, continues to perform at a high level in a brutal sport where the average player lasts four to five years. Mahomes, 25, is in his fourth year. Despite their age difference, it has taken them both physical and mental strength to get to the elite level they share.

Daniel Vigil, MD, a sports medicine specialist at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and a team physician for UCLA Athletics and the Los Angeles Lakers, knows Brady's longevity in the NFL is no small feat.

“Football is a violent, high-speed, high-velocity collision sport. It's hard to imagine someone having a career as long as Tom has. What amazes me about Tom is that he’s played this game for so long at a high level,” Dr. Vigil says.

“Athletes like Tom develop nuances to their training regimen and overall health that help them last a long time. It comes with proper diet and training,” he says. “We see it with LeBron. We saw it with Kobe and even Wayne Gretzky. The difference is Tom is playing in a much more violent sport – though a hockey player may argue otherwise.”

It’s no secret that nutrition and training play a major role in Brady’s longevity. According to TB12sports.com, a website that supports the TB12 health and wellness movement co-founded by Brady, the quarterback follows a predominantly plant-based diet.

Brady says his day starts at 6 am, as he fuels himself with electrolytes and nutrients. This includes drinking 20 ounces of water and a high-protein smoothie with bananas, blueberries, nuts and seeds. His daily training session usually begins around 8 am, Brady typically replenishing his body with water every 20 minutes. Once his workout concludes, Brady continues filling his body with whole grains and vegetables throughout the day.

“Nutrition is super important to perform well and Tom understands this. He knows how to take care of his body,” said Deviny Mo, manager at UCLA Health Sports Performance Powered by EXOS. “If you want to last long and perform at a high level like Tom you have to eat food that is going to help you perform better and train better. If you view your body as a Ferrari, you’re not going to go to your typical AM/PM gas station to fuel up on regular gas. You’re going to need a higher quality of fuel.”</h3>
