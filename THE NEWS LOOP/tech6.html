 <h3>The debate over new AI laws is intensifying as governments, tech companies, and experts clash over how to regulate rapidly advancing artificial intelligence technologies. Supporters of stronger regulations argue that clear rules are essential to ensure safety, transparency, and accountability, especially in areas like facial recognition, automated decision-making, and deepfake content. On the other hand, tech firms warn that overly strict laws could stifle innovation and slow down progress. As AI becomes more powerful and widespread, the pressure is mounting to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting public interest — making this debate one of the most critical in today’s digital era.</h3>
