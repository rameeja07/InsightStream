 <h3>Puneri Paltan is having a strong run in the 2025 Pro Kabaddi League Season 12.
     Recently, they secured a convincing 45–36 victory over Bengal Warriorz,
      with their captain Aslam Inamdar delivering a Super Raid, 
      while Aditya Shinde and Vishal Bhardwaj contributed impressive performances.
       The team also dominated Gujarat Giants with a 41–19 win,
        highlighted by key contributions from Abinesh Nadarajan and Pankaj Mohite,
         who surpassed 400 PKL points. Under the new leadership of head coach Ajay Thakur
         , the former Indian captain, the team aims to bounce back from last season’s disappointing finish.
          They have strengthened their squad by signing raider Sachin Tanwar for ₹1.058 crore,
           adding more depth and experience to their attack. With this revamped lineup and strategic guidance
           , Puneri Paltan is poised to be a strong contender for the PKL title this season,
            and fans are optimistic about their chances of success.</h3>
