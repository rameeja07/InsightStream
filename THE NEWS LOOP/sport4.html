    <h2><b>Heisman Watch: Rising stars</b></h2>
    <p><i>Key prospects in the 2025 college football season spotlighted.</i></p>

<h3>  Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel has taken over as the Heisman favorite at BetMGM. Gabriel’s odds of +240 are just ahead of Colorado WR/DB Travis Hunter at +250. On Monday, Hunter became the first player to win Big 12 offensive player of the week and defensive player of the week in the same week after his performance in the Buffaloes’ win over Cincinnati.

Miami QB Cam Ward is at +300, while Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty is fourth at +450. Jeanty had emerged as the midseason Heisman favorite given his absurd statistics, but his odds have gotten longer behind players in power conferences.

There’s a big gap to everyone else. Behind Jeanty, the next-smallest odds are +2500. There’s a very good chance this year’s Heisman winner will be one of those four players. But with so many top teams off in Week 10 ahead of the stretch run, we figured this was a good time to take a look at five quarterbacks who have a chance to sneak into the Heisman race. Here are five players to watch on Saturday as a lot of teams will be enjoying their second off weekend of the season.

Clemson QB Cade Klubnik (+2500)
We’re pretty bullish on Klubnik’s chances to get an invite to New York City if he continues to lead Clemson’s offense like this. The Tigers are the No. 4 scoring team in college football at 42 points per game and are averaging 48.5 points per game against all teams not named Georgia. Klubnik is completing two-thirds of his passes so far this season with 20 TDs and just three interceptions. He’s also rushed for four scores. Klubnik is averaging over two yards more per passing attempt in 2024 than he did in 2023 and his odds could drop significantly over the next three weeks with strong performances against Louisville, Virginia Tech and Pitt.

Georgia QB Carson Beck (+3500)
Beck’s odds are probably so low because of his name recognition at this point. His stats are down nearly across the board from where they were in 2023 and he’s already thrown two more interceptions than he did all of last season. You can’t discount his chances of sneaking back into the mix, however. A big game against Florida would happen on an otherwise light college football slate and Georgia’s next two games are against No. 19 Ole Miss and No. 7 Tennessee. If Beck is the best player on the field in those two contests, his odds will drop.
