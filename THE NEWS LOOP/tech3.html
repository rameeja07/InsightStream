  <h2><b>Whale-Tagging Drone Innovation</b></h2>
  <p><i>Technology takes flight—tagging giants of the sea without touching a boat.</i></p>

<h3>Alright, this is gonna be the one!” The 22-foot inflatable research vessel Balena speeds up and approaches a group of four humpback whales along the edge of Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary offshore Provincetown, Massachusetts. “A little closer! Closer!” There’s a brief silence in the air—everyone seems to be holding their breath as we wait for Sanctuary Scientist Mike Thompson to extend the pole far enough for the tag to stick to the back of the humpback whale. Just as the whale begins to arch its back to do a deep dive, the four suction cups on the tag adhere to its skin. The whale’s large black and white tail flicks above the water’s surface, then the massive animal disappears beneath the murky water.

This whale’s name is Azrael. We know this from a photo identification database that allows researchers to identify and name individual whales based on unique features on their tails. Patterns develop from natural pigmentation, scarring from predators or other wildlife encounters, and from interactions with humans (e.g., entanglement in fishing gear). Another whale swimming in Azrael’s group was tagged that day too—it’s name is 3.14 because it has what resembles a pi symbol (π) on the left lobe of its tail.</h3>
