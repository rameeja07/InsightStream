	Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders will urge Donald Trump on Monday to spell out his security guarantees for Ukraine in the face of Vladimir Putin’s demands that Kyiv concede land to reach a truce with Russia.

The push for clarity from the US comes on the eve of a hastily arranged meeting at the White House where the Ukrainian president and western leaders will seek to thrash out a position to end Russia’s full-scale invasion.

Zelenskyy and European leaders scrambled over the weekend to find common ground with the US, after Trump dropped his demand for an immediate ceasefire after meeting the Russian president in Alaska on Friday.

Trump on Sunday night appeared to put further pressure on Zelenskyy ahead of Monday’s meeting.<br><br>

“[Zelenskyy] can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,” he wrote on Truth Social. It would be a “Big day at the White House tomorrow”.

Ukraine’s leader found some encouragement in the US president’s apparent willingness to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war ends, to prevent another attack by Russia.

But Zelenskyy wrote on X that those guarantees “must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation”.

Ahead of the meeting, Ukraine’s air force said Russia had launched four missiles and 140 drones in an overnight attack on several cities including Kharkiv.

  LONDON -- Russia's Foreign Ministry again warned that Moscow will not accept the presence of any Western troops in Ukraine as part of a future peace deal, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met a group of top European leaders in Paris on Thursday.<br><br>

"Russia does not intend to discuss unacceptable foreign intervention in Ukraine in any form whatsoever," spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in comments published by the Foreign Ministry on Thursday. "Western war instigators view Ukraine as a testing ground for their military developments," she said.

Moscow has repeatedly rebuffed proposals for Western forces to be deployed to Ukraine in any capacity as part of a deal to end Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor, which began in February 2022.<br><br>

Nonetheless, the prospect is still under discussion by NATO leaders and the Ukrainian government as an element of the security guarantees Kyiv says are needed to facilitate any U.S.-brokered peace deal.

Zakharova said Thursday that the protections under discussion "are not security guarantees for Ukraine, they are guarantees of threat to the European continent."<br><br>The remarks came before Zelenskyy gathered with European leaders -- the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" -- for further talks in Paris on Thursday. The group also spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump, who called into the meeting, the White House said.<br><br>
"President Trump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war -- as Russia received €1.1 billion in fuel sales from the EU in one year," a White House official said following the call. "The president also emphasized that European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia's war efforts."<br><br>
European and Canadian leaders finalized a plan outlining potential security guarantees for Ukraine, with 26 countries expressing readiness to take direct action, French President Emmanuel Macron announced following the meeting. Macron said several countries are prepared to contribute "on land, in the sea or in the air" to "reassure the people of Ukraine and maintain the ceasefire once it's implemented, and maintain and guarantee peace." "The plan will now be taken to the U.S. with the intention of formalizing it in the coming days," Macron said. <br></P>
