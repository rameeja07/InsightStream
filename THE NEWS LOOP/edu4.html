    <h3>Delhi Public School Gaya, has set an example in nurturing young talents in the field of science and technology. The school has recently established three state-of-the-art robotics labs on its campus, making it the only school in Bihar and one of the few schools across India with dedicated robotics labs for different cohorts.

The school’s well-equipped Robotics labs, in combination with a supportive learning environment,
 have motivated students to explore their interests and channel their creativity into tangible projects. 
 With each lab catering to a particular age group, the youngest, from Pre-nursery to Class 2, use LEGO kits like Duplo and Coding Express to learn STEM concepts through fun-based learning. Students in Classes 3 to 5 use BRICQ motion kits, Spike essential kits, and coding skills to learn various science concepts and develop scientific temperaments. Meanwhile, in the senior wing lab, students in Classes 6 to 12 learn cutting-edge tech such as 3D designing, AI, rapid prototyping, and advanced prototyping to create their innovations. These labs help students think out of the box, nurture problem-solving skills,
 and encourage them to turn their ideas into reality.</h3>
