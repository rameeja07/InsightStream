    <h2><b>Google's AI rivals get boost from data-sharing order</b></h2>
    <p><i>Data unlocked is power shared â€” a new wave of AI innovation rises with open access.</i></p>

<h3>A recent data-sharing order has given a significant boost to Google's AI rivals, leveling the playing field in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. The mandate, which requires tech giants like Google to share certain datasets and models with smaller firms and researchers, is aimed at promoting fairness, transparency, and competition in the AI ecosystem. By opening access to high-quality data that was once tightly held, emerging AI companies now have the tools to train more advanced models and accelerate innovation. This move is seen as a major step toward democratizing AI development and reducing monopolistic control in the tech industry.</h3>
